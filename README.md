# PokeSnap

Make dataset myself, use photo dataset enhancement to expand the dataset. Use opencv to preprocess the images, including channel conversion, hue separation, open and close operations, Otsu method mask extraction, convex packet extraction.

Use decision tree and adaboost to [predict](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/PokeSnap/blob/main/adaboost/predict.py) the class of pokemon.
